    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Kolm%C3%A5rden_Wolf.jpg" alt="The wolf is the largest
     extant member of the Canidae family,[31] and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout,
      shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail.[32][31] It is slender and powerfully built, with a large, deeply
       descending rib cage, a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck.[33] The wolf's legs are moderately longer than 
       those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and to overcome the deep snow that covers most 
       of its geographical range in winter.[34] The ears are relatively small and triangular.[33] The wolf's head is 
       large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle.[35] The skull is 230–280 mm 
       (9–11 in) in length and 130–150 mm (5–6 in) in width.[36] The teeth are heavy and large, making them better 
       suited to crushing bone than those of other canids, though they are not as specialized as those found in 
       hyenas.[37][38] Its molars have a flat chewing surface, but not to the same extent as the coyote, whose 
       diet contains more vegetable matter.[39] Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner 
       necks, slightly shorter legs, and less massive shoulders than males.[40]">
